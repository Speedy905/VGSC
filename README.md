Video Game Storage Creator rewritten in Shell

What's this?
------------
This is a rewrite of my [Grade 12 Culminating](https://github.com/Speedy905/Video-Game-Storage-Creator) in shell where we had to write a program in Python and also follow specific requirements as well. While this rewrite doesn't follow all the requirements, it still follows the structure and main purpose.

Why?
----
I wanted to see if I can make this work, and so far I've been able to rewrite it.

What's new in this rewrite?
---------------------------
- New consoles added to fit in with the times
- Error checking, and file searching

Thanks to
---------
- [tPenguinLTG](https://github.com/tpenguinltg) and [Kevin911Dashire](https://github.com/Kevin911Dashire) for beta testing and suggesting new things
- Wikipedia for the list of [genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres) and consoles
- My high school Computer Science teacher for teaching me coding. While i still pursued on system administartion, this still allowed me to experiment and see how to make this work.

Notes
-----
This program will still be updated overtime. New things will be added and others might get removed. I've determined that the MVP should be easily accessible in the meantime.

How to execute
--------------
1. Clone the repo
2. Start the program with [start.sh](https://github.com/Speedy905/VGSC/blob/main/start.sh)
